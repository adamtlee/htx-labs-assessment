# HTX Labs Assesment

1. How do you determine if a 3D point lies inside a 3D sphere?

2. The following diagram contains 5 squares in a 2x2 configuration (four 1x1 + one 2x2):
Implement a function in either C++ or C# that takes a parameter of N, where N is the size of
the NxN matrix of any size greater than 0 and returns the total number of squares in the
matrix. For example, in C++ the function signature looks like this:

3. Design the interface for a game particle system in C#. The system should support creating
multiple particle groups in the game world. Show only the interface to the system, without
implementation. Assume the existence of any math libraries or other systems you need for the
interface:

a. Each particle group has a type id that defines (via a lookup table not shown here) the number of
particles, the lifetime of each particle, the velocities of the particles, etc. 
b. Given a type id, particle groups can be created. 
c. Particle groups are attached to models, placed at a location, or exist only in screen space. 
d. Particle groups can be scaled and rotated. 
e. Particle groups can be ended early.

4. Define a list of unit tests to validate an implementation of the particle system interface from the
previous question.

5. Write a boid system in C# or JS. You can use any libraries or tech you want. The only stipulation
is that the system needs to simulate a flying insect swarm instead of the normal birds/fish. The
deliverable on this is the code as well as a screenshot (or video) that you think best exemplifies the
behavior.

6. Consider an e-commerce system that will support multiple forms of payment, a shopping cart,
discount codes, targeted marketing…basically imagine Amazon. Describe the minimum viable product
for that system.

7. If you have a database that is getting overloaded with a large number of requests per second,
how would you generally diagnose and fix the issue?
